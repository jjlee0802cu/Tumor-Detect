Tumor Detection AI
===
During the summer of 2015, I interned as a software engineer at Medical Image Research Inc. and created a tumor detection AI. The AI primarily utilizes edge detection and image segmentation techniques in order indentify tumor growths within MRI images. Specifically, the AI is tailored to perform optimally on brain MRI images. Furthermore, the AI reconstructs tumors in 3-Dimensions through the image segmentation of several MRI images and identifies the approximate volume of said tumor.

The applications are self-explanatory: to aid doctors and radiologists in tumor detection and to provide them with vital information regarding the diagnosis of cancers.
