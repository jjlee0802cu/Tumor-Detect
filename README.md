===
During the summer of 2015, I interned at Medical Image Research Inc. and I created a tumor detection and volumetric measurement tool. After receiving MRI images and data from the University of Illinois at Chicago, I developed an algorithm to aid doctors in tumor detection and the diagnosis of cancers.
